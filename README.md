## Publish a new version

NPM publishing is automated. To release a new version, tag the local development repository with

    npm version patch

This will bump up one minor version. The general rules for semantic versioning are as follows: 

    npm version [<newversion> | major | minor | patch | premajor | preminor | prepatch | prerelease | from-git]

After this, head over to github releases section and tag the version with the new version obtained by executing the above.
